Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about context, see the [Contexts guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).",

            "Although the use of lossy encodings is not recommended, if a very low bitrate encoding is required, `OGG_OPUS` is highly preferred over Speex encoding. The [Speex](https://speex.org/) encoding supported by Dialogflow API has a header byte in each block, as in MIME type `audio/x-speex-with-header-byte`. It is a variant of the RTP Speex encoding defined in [RFC 5574](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5574). The stream is a sequence of blocks, one block per RTP packet. Each block starts with a byte containing the length of the block, in bytes, followed by one or more frames of Speex data, padded to an integral number of bytes (octets) as specified in RFC 5574. In other words, each RTP header is replaced with a single byte containing the block length. Only Speex wideband is supported. `sample_rate_hertz` must be 16000."

When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active.

There are three types of entities: * **System** - entities that are defined by the Dialogflow API for common data types such as date, time, currency, and so on. A system entity is represented by the `EntityType` type. * **Custom** - entities that are defined by you that represent actionable data that is meaningful to your application. For example, you could define a `pizza.sauce` entity for red or white pizza sauce, a `pizza.cheese` entity for the different types of cheese on a pizza, a `pizza.topping` entity for different toppings, and so on. A custom entity is represented by the `EntityType` type. * **User** - entities that are built for an individual user such as favorites, preferences, playlists, and so on. A user entity is represented by the SessionEntityType type. For more information about entity types, see the [Dialogflow documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/entities-overview).",

If the user's response does not fill the parameter, a no-match/no-input event will be triggered, and the fulfillment associated with the `sys.no-match-1`/`sys.no-input-1` handler (if defined) will be called to provide a prompt. The `sys.no-match-2`/`sys.no-input-2` handler (if defined) will respond to the next no-match/no-input event, and so on. A `sys.no-match-default` or `sys.no-input-default` handler will be used to handle all following no-match/no-input events after all numbered no-match/no-input handlers for the parameter are consumed. A `sys.invalid-parameter` handler can be defined to handle the case where the parameter values have been `invalidated` by webhook. For example, if the user's response fill the parameter, however the parameter was invalidated by webhook, the fulfillment associated with the `sys.invalid-parameter` handler (if defined) will be called to provide a prompt.

For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.",
